# Perceptron-Model

#### This is an example of a working version of the perceptron machine learning model created from scratch. I implement both batch and sequential fitting options, and also added in functionality for it to run on a non linearly separable datset. There is analysis about the initial weight vectors and how they correlate to learning rates, and comments about how the optimal learning rates will differ between batch and sequential training based on the dataset.
